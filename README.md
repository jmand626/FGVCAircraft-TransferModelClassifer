Simply follow the notebook cells. You should run every single file when you first open it, but you may not need to run each cell if you come back and run it again. Still, it should be ok because the code will first search for the dataset to see if it's already downloaded. The first cell, however, might not be strictly necessary, but I included it so the notebook can visually appear without issues on GitHub.

Understanding it is crucial.
